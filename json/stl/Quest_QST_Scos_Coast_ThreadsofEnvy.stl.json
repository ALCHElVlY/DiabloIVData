  "Phase108Description": "The wight ritual at Linnéad revealed a statue of the fiend and knowledge of its lair in the far north. It also spoke of a test—but that did not give Roina pause.\r\n\r\nI should meet Roina at the Eternal Watch. Together, we’ll put an end to the wight.",
  "Phase53Description": "We’ve found the wight’s lair. The fiend hides deep beneath Eternal Watch, thriving in the murk. \r\n\r\nIt’s time Roina and I put an end to the wight’s corruption.",
  "Phase79Description": "Roina and I faced the wight, only to find that the creature was her mother—twisted by its corruption. Though we defeated the fiend, Roina is clearly troubled by the revelation.\r\n\r\nI should speak with her in Marowen and see how she’s faring.",
  "Toast": "More than a monster waits in the deep."
