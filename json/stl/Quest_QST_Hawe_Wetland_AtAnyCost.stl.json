  "Phase0Description": "My heart sinks upon learning that Symon's traveling companion was Elias. If true, it is hard to imagine that Symon still lives. \r\n\r\nStill, if there is even the smallest chance he is alive, I will continue on. The pilgrims directed me towards a refuge in the marshes marked by giant tusks.",
