  "Name": "A Pyre of Ash",
  "Phase0Description": "Torben told me the worn insignia belonged to a mercenary company from the Days of Ash. Blackweald Company. The same company of the fabled killer, the Bear of Blackweald.\r\n\r\nTorben seems disturbed by the idea that they have returned. I should speak with him to see how they’re related to the merchant killings.",
  "Phase11Description": "As Torben was telling me about Blackweald Company, we were interrupted by news of a large fire spotted on the southern ridge. Torben seemed disquieted by the news, saying he believes the fires are connected to Blackweald Company’s return.\r\n\r\nHe asked that I search for the source of the fires while he protects the Goose and its patrons.",
  "Phase16Description": "I found the source of the smoke—a pyre of human corpses. Scorched bodies lead to a nearby cellar entrance. I’m sure to find answers within.",
  "Toast": "Embers rise again from fires extinguished long ago."
